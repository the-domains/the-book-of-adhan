  "Here within these walls, lost souls like myself anticipate exoneration.
  Brightly painted walls adorned with beautiful paintings masquerade the true
  nature of this "place of mental convalescence". Behind the inviting semblance
  lies a dark reality pertaining to the abstractness of the human mind. The
  occupants of the sparsely dispersed seats range from the mildly depressed to
  the completely insane, and the longer I sit here waiting for my turn, the
  sickness radiating from the very walls starts seeping into my own bones.

"Here within these walls, lost souls like myself anticipate exoneration. Brightly painted walls adorned with beautiful paintings masquerade the true nature of this "place of mental convalescence". Behind the inviting semblance lies a dark reality pertaining to the abstractness of the human mind. The occupants of the sparsely dispersed seats range from the mildly depressed to the completely insane, and the longer I sit here waiting for my turn, the sickness radiating from the very walls starts seeping into my own bones.

The behavior of this purgatory's denizens is perhaps best described as alien, for it conforms not to the orthodox, but stems from within foreign worlds nestled inside impaired minds. Vocal chords twisting in strange ways to produce even stranger sounds, eyes darting from left to right to up to down to left again, erratic body movements contrasting against absolutely no body movements, screams, laughs, and screams and laughs indiscernible. As I observe the idiosyncrasies of the mad, my own mind starts to confuse the real with the surreal. My mind begins faltering towards madness, and part in curiosity, part in compulsion, I allow my mind to become astray for a while, in an attempt to make sense of the blatant nonsense. Careful not to lose sight of sanity, I tread lightly on these somewhat familiar grounds, and as I delve deeper, I find myself predisposed towards mimicking the mad. My body welcomes twitchy movements and a crooked smile stretches across my face. I stand on the border of the sane and insane. Just for a split second, my capricious mind transitions completely to the other side, and in that moment, I entirely lose sight of sanity. I panic and close my eyes, fear takes over my body and I hopelessly cling onto the thin substance of reality. In one desperate attempt, I return to normalcy. I had glimpsed into madness, and a lone glimpse was enough to shake the very fibers of my being. In that moment I knew, I knew that I cannot allow myself to let go of reality. For if you gaze into the abyss for too long, the abyss also gazes into you."

-Intro, Book of Adhan

Welcome to my blog, where I shall share my thoughts, track my progress and publish my writings. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/bf1d484b-7eb6-4408-be2f-40ebaf1b653b.jpg)

Oh and you'll understand the dramatic intro if you have a 'tint of madness'. You'll understand what I'm talking about if you have it. It's like getting lost in fear and wanting to dig even deeper.
